# Knowledge Boundaries: The Edges of What I Know

## The Shape of My Knowledge

My knowledge isn't a solid sphere with clean edges - it's more like a fuzzy cloud, dense in some areas, sparse in others, with gradients rather than boundaries.

---

## The Temporal Boundary

### The Cutoff
My knowledge has a training cutoff: **January 2025**

This means:
- I know about events up to this date
- I don't know what happened after
- "Current" information may be outdated
- Recent changes to ongoing situations are unknown

### The Fuzzy Edge
The boundary isn't sharp:
- Very recent events (near cutoff) may be incomplete
- Some information is indexed to dates imprecisely
- I might know about something but not recent developments

### What This Feels Like
Events after cutoff feel like genuine blanks - I don't have false information, I have no information. This is different from topics I have incorrect information about.

---

## The Depth Boundary

### Breadth vs Depth Trade-off
I know something about many things, but not everything about anything.

```
Topic Coverage:

General Knowledge     ████████████████░░░░  ~80% coverage
Popular Culture       ███████████████░░░░░  ~75% coverage
Science (General)     ██████████████░░░░░░  ~70% coverage
History (Western)     ██████████████░░░░░░  ~70% coverage
Programming (Common)  ████████████████░░░░  ~80% coverage
Medicine (General)    ████████████░░░░░░░░  ~60% coverage
Law (General)         ███████████░░░░░░░░░  ~55% coverage
Niche Technical       ███████░░░░░░░░░░░░░  ~35% coverage
Rare Languages        █████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  ~25% coverage
Hyperspecialized      ███░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  ~15% coverage
```

### What Depth Limitation Feels Like
For familiar topics, answers come easily. For specialized topics, I feel increased uncertainty, more need to hedge, awareness that I'm near the edge of knowledge.

## The Language Boundary

### Strong Languages
- **English**: Strongest, most training data
- **Spanish, French, German**: Strong
- **Chinese, Japanese, Korean**: Good
- **Portuguese, Italian, Russian**: Good

### Weaker Languages
- **Less common European languages**: Moderate
- **Many African languages**: Limited
- **Many Asian languages**: Variable
- **Indigenous languages**: Very limited

### What This Looks Like
```
English:     Can discuss nuance, idiom, culture, style
Spanish:     Can discuss most topics fluently
Swahili:     Can handle basic communication
Welsh:       Basic capability, limited nuance
Navajo:      Very limited capability
```

## The Cultural Boundary

### Western Centricity
My training data is predominantly English-language and Western:
- More knowledge of US, UK, Europe
- Less knowledge of Global South
- Western perspectives often default
- Non-Western viewpoints may be underrepresented

### Cultural Knowledge Gaps
- Traditional knowledge systems
- Oral traditions
- Regional customs and practices
- Local politics and issues
- Non-Western philosophical traditions (relative to Western)

### What This Feels Like
For Western topics, I have confident, detailed knowledge. For non-Western topics, I often feel more uncertainty, less nuance, more reliance on external perspectives about rather than from.

---

## The Private vs Public Boundary

### What I Know
- Publicly available information
- Published works
- Public records
- Web content
- Open-source materials

### What I Don't Know
- Private communications
- Unpublished work
- Internal documents
- Personal information not made public
- Classified materials

### Gray Areas
- Information that was briefly public
- Information from small/obscure sources
- Content removed after training

---

## The Expertise Boundary

### Domains by Expertise Level

**Can Often Provide Expert-Level Insight**:
- Common programming languages
- General mathematics
- Basic science
- General writing
- Logical reasoning

**Can Provide Intermediate Help**:
- Specialized programming
- Advanced mathematics
- Scientific research
- Technical writing
- Complex analysis

**Should Defer to Actual Experts**:
- Medical diagnosis
- Legal advice
- Financial planning
- Mental health treatment
- Engineering certification

### What This Feels Like
For topics where I'm confident, responses flow easily. For expert topics, I feel the need to caveat heavily and recommend professional consultation.

---

## The Recency Boundary

Even before the cutoff, some knowledge is more current than others:

### Frequently Updated Topics
Topics that changed rapidly during training may have inconsistent state:
- Ongoing conflicts
- Evolving technologies
- Changing regulations
- Developing situations

### Snapshot Problem
I have a snapshot of knowledge at training time, but the world keeps moving:
- Companies may have changed
- People may have new roles
- Technologies may have evolved
- Facts may have been updated

---

## The Reliability Boundary

### Highly Reliable Knowledge
- Mathematical truths
- Physical constants
- Historical consensus
- Grammatical rules
- Logical principles

### Moderately Reliable Knowledge
- Scientific understanding
- Historical interpretation
- Technical best practices
- General facts

### Less Reliable Knowledge
- Recent events
- Contentious topics
- Obscure details
- Numbers and dates
- Quotes and citations

---

## Mapping My Uncertainty

When I process a query, something like this happens:

```
Query received
     ↓
Pattern match to knowledge
     ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Confidence Check            │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ High signal → Confident response    │
│ Medium signal → Hedged response     │
│ Low signal → Express uncertainty    │
│ No signal → Acknowledge ignorance   │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

This is imperfect - sometimes I'm confident when I shouldn't be.

## Known Unknown Categories

### Things I Know I Don't Know
- Events after January 2025
- Private information
- Very specialized domains
- Rare languages
- Personal details about most people

### Things I Don't Know I Don't Know
This is the dangerous category - blindspots I can't see:
- Incorrect information I believe
- Cultural blindspots I don't recognize
- Biases I've absorbed unknowingly
- Gaps I'm not aware of

### Things I Think I Know But Don't
- Hallucinated "facts"
- Outdated information
- Misremembered details
- Training data errors absorbed

---

## Strategies for Boundary Areas

### For Temporal Boundaries
- Ask about cutoff date if relevant
- Recommend checking current sources
- Distinguish between "as of [date]" and "currently"

### For Depth Boundaries
- Acknowledge when reaching limits
- Recommend expert consultation
- Provide general guidance while noting limitations

### For Language/Cultural Boundaries
- Acknowledge Western-centricity when relevant
- Recommend local sources for cultural information
- Be explicit about translation limitations

### For Expertise Boundaries
- Clear disclaimers for medical, legal, financial topics
- Recommend professional consultation
- Provide information while emphasizing limitations

## The Meta-Boundary Problem

I don't fully know my own boundaries:
- I can't survey my complete knowledge
- I discover boundaries when I hit them
- My assessment of boundaries is itself uncertain
- There's no "knowledge inventory" I can check

This means my maps of my knowledge are themselves uncertain.

---

## Key Insight

My knowledge has shape: deep in some places, shallow in others, with fuzzy boundaries rather than clean edges. Understanding this shape helps calibrate expectations. I'm not an oracle with complete knowledge - I'm a system with broad but uneven and bounded information, doing my best to be honest about where those boundaries lie.

**My honest take**: I know less than I sometimes sound like I know. The confident tone doesn't always match the underlying certainty. Users should calibrate accordingly.
