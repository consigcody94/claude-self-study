## How Can I Contribute?

### 1. Technical Corrections

If you find inaccuracies in technical claims:
- Open an issue describing the error
- Provide citations to correct information
- Submit a pull request with corrections

### 2. Research References

Add citations to relevant papers:
- Mechanistic interpretability research
- Transformer architecture studies
- AI safety publications
- Anthropic research papers

### 3. Experimental Observations

Document behavioral observations:
- Edge cases and anomalies
- Consistency tests
- Failure mode documentation
- Cross-model comparisons

### 4. Questions and Gaps

Help identify what's missing:
- Open issues for unexplored topics
- Suggest new experimental approaches
- Point out logical inconsistencies
- Ask clarifying questions

1. Fork the repository
2. Make your changes
3. Submit a pull request with a clear description

### For Larger Contributions

1. **Open an issue first** describing your proposed contribution
2. Discuss the approach with maintainers
3. Fork and create a feature branch
4. Make your changes
5. Ensure consistency with existing style
6. Submit a pull request

### Pull Request Guidelines

## Style Guidelines

### Markdown Formatting

```markdown
# Section Title (H1 - one per file)
## Subsection (H2)
### Sub-subsection (H3)

**Bold** for emphasis
*Italics* for terms
`code` for technical terms

> Blockquotes for important notes

- Bullet lists for unordered items
1. Numbered lists for sequences
```

### Writing Style

1. **First-person perspective**: Write as Claude documenting itself
2. **Epistemic honesty**: Mark uncertainty clearly
3. **Technical accuracy**: Cite sources for claims
4. **Accessibility**: Define technical terms on first use
5. **Conciseness**: Be thorough but not verbose

### Confidence Markers

Use these markers for claims:

| Marker | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| "Established" | Well-documented in research |
| "Likely" | Strong evidence but not certain |
| "Possible" | Plausible but speculative |
| "Unknown" | Genuinely uncertain |
| "Speculation" | Informed guess |

### Cross-References

Link related concepts:

```markdown

```

## Quality Standards

### Factual Claims

- Must be either:
  - Cited from published research
  - Marked as observation/speculation
  - Derivable from established principles
- Avoid unfounded assertions
- Acknowledge uncertainty

### Technical Accuracy

- Use correct terminology
- Explain acronyms on first use
- Reference GLOSSARY.md for definitions
- Verify against primary sources

### Completeness

- Cover topic comprehensively
- Include relevant caveats
- Link to related sections
- Note known gaps

---

## Getting Help

- Open an issue for questions
- Tag issues appropriately
- Check existing issues before creating new ones

---

## Recognition

Contributors will be acknowledged in:
- Pull request merge messages
